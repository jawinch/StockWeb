	<title>Stocks Webscraper</title>
	Welcome!<br>
	We made a python program which can scrap the prices of stocks from a website. 
	I worked on the output part of our program. For example, I worked on the twillio part and calculating whether or not the change in price has surpassed the threshold set by the user.
