		The hardest part of the webscraper was how it wouldn't scrape the price from the website. For some reason the numbers were being output in JS so we needed to use Geckodriver to open the website in firefox and grab the numbers in js. <br>Furthermore, we spent awhile trying to figure out how to convert our two prices to a percent difference, but for some unknown reason it wouldn't work so we had to scrap it.
